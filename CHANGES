v2.6.0
------

- Add `Client.SubscribeWithContext` and `Client.UnsubscribeWithContext` to support
  context-aware subscription management.

v2.5.0
------

- Add `Client.Unsubscribe` allowing unsubscriptions on the high level client.

v2.4.1
------

- Prevent race condition in `salesforce.StaticTokenAuthenticator`

v2.4.0
------

- Add client option `WithIgnoreError` to continue polling even if an error is
  returned on `Subscribe`/`Unsubscribe` if the callback function returns true.

- Stop relying on `http.DefaultClient` if the user does not pass their own
  `http.Client`. Instead, build a new one relying on the default client's
  settings

v2.3.0
------

- Use a `Logger` interface instead of logrus.FieldLogger directly to allow for
  other loggers to be passed in.

v2.2.0
------

- Return the response `Body` as part of a `BadResponseError`

v2.1.2
------

- Fix implicit dependency of v2/extensions/replay on v1 and references to v1
  documentation

v2.1.1
------

- Fix issue with v2 not being published properly as a module

v2.1.0
------

- Add concrete error types to package to make checking errors easier (rather
  than returning errors dynamically from functions that would require string
  checking). See also https://github.com/sigmavirus24/gobayeux/pull/20

- Fix bug where message extensions were applied after messages were already
  encoded. See also https://github.com/sigmavirus24/gobayeux/pull/12

v2.0.0
------

- It appears that most clients handle the "subscription" field of a message as
  a string despite the specification clearly stating it can be an array of
  strings. As a result, we've changed the definition and how we build
  subscription messages.

v1.0.0
------

- Finalize API for client work
